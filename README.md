# SublimeText3-Configuration
My configuration for Sublime Text

Say you want to use your config on an other computer, hereâ€™s what you have to do:
    - remove the Packages/User folder of the fresh install
    - clone the backup, rename this to User
    - install Package Control
    - restart Sublime Text
