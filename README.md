# SublimeText3-Configuration

My configuration for Sublime Text

Say you want to use your config on an other computer, hereâ€™s what you have to do:

    - remove the Packages/User folder of the fresh install
    - clone the backup, rename this to User
    - install Package Control
    - restart Sublime Text

Hints:

1. Check your git configuration: ```git config --list```
2. After pushing to git (and being asked for your login/password, save the credentials so that you don't need to re-enter: ```git config --global credential.helper cache```)
